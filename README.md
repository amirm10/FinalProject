# FinalProject
This repository contains the materials for the final B.Sc. project titled “Authorship Verification Framework Leveraging Impostor Projection and Siamese Architectures.”
The project focuses on the design and implementation of an authorship verification framework aimed at determining whether a given text was written by a specific author.

At this stage, the repository includes the project book, system flow diagrams, and supporting documentation. Additional components such as source code, experiments, and evaluation results will be gradually added as the project progresses. The framework is designed to address real-world challenges including short texts, adversarial style imitation, and open-set verification scenarios.
