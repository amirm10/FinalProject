📌 Project Overview
This research-oriented project aims to develop a robust framework for Authorship Verification—determining whether a specific author wrote a given text. Unlike standard attribution, this framework is designed to operate in adversarial environments, effectively handling short texts, domain shifts, and intentional writing style imitation.
The solution integrates:
•	Contextual Embeddings: Using BERT to capture semantic meaning.
•	Hybrid Neural Architecture: A CNN-BiLSTM layer for stylistic pattern extraction and sequential flow modeling.
•	Adversarial Training: Implementing the Impostor Projection Method to improve resilience against forgery.
•	Signal Analysis: Treating text as a temporal signal and using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) for alignment.
Anomaly Detection: Utilizing Isolation Forest to flag suspicious texts.

🚀 Future Work (Phase B)
The next phase will focus on implementation and empirical validation:
•	Development using Python and PyTorch.
•	Model training on authentic authorship datasets.
•	Adversarial Stress Testing using AI-generated and human-mimicked content.
•	Evaluation based on Accuracy and F1-Score.
